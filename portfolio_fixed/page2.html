        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my world of movement and expression!</p>
        <p>
          I'm Tamar Rosenzveig, a dancer and performer based in the vibrant city
          of Tel Aviv, Israel. With a journey that spans from the prestigious
          BatSheva Ensemble Company to the diverse independent dance scene, I've
          had the privilege of exploring the endless possibilities of movement
          and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dance odyssey began at a young age with the renowned Hora Jerusalem
          folk dance company, where I discovered the exhilaration of performing
          on stage and the power of artistic collaboration. From there, my
          passion for classical ballet took root, leading me to the esteemed
          halls of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and the Maslool
          Program for Professional Dancers in Tel Aviv.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining the BatSheva Ensemble Company was a transformative
          experience—a chance to immerse myself in the groundbreaking works of
          Ohad Naharin and Gili Navot, and to discover the boundless potential
          of movement as a form of storytelling and expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, I've been drawn to the dynamic energy of the
          independent dance scene, collaborating with visionary choreographers
          like Dana Rutenberg, Ariel Cohen, and Omri Drumlevich. Each project
          has been a journey of exploration and discovery, pushing the
          boundaries of my artistry and challenging me to evolve as a performer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, no journey is without its challenges. In 2022, I faced a
          setback—a surgery on my meniscus that tested my resilience and
          determination. But through perseverance and dedication, I embraced the
          healing process, emerging stronger and more inspired than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I'm excited to embark on a new chapter as I pursue
          certification as a Gyrokinesis and Gyrotonic teacher—a chance to share
          my love of movement with others and to inspire the next generation of
          dancers and performers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for joining me on this incredible journey. Together, let's
          celebrate the beauty of movement, the power of expression, and the
          endless possibilities of creativity.
        </p>
        <p>With gratitude,</p>
        <p>Tamar</p>
